Explanation:

1. The code opens the specified file (message_file) and reads its lines.
2. It calculates the pyramid_height using a formula based on the number of lines.
3. It sorts the lines based on the indices provided in the file.
4. It identifies the corner indices of the pyramid using a formula.
5. It iterates through the sorted lines and extracts the last word from lines corresponding to corner indices.
6. It joins the extracted words into a string to form the decoded message.
7. The main program calls the decode function and prints the decoded message.
This approach ensures that the words are extracted in the correct order from the file based on the pyramid structure.
